# Instanews

## Summary
<p>http://janekim0730.github.io/Project02-API-Instanews/<p>
<p>InstaNews is a responsive single page website incorporating Ajax, JSON and API concepts.<p>
<p>The site dynamically fetches story data and populates it in a webpage via the Top Stories API based a user's selection from a select field.</p>
<p>The header area including NY Times logo resizes so that it transitions from occupying the entire screen on page load to only auto height after the select form is changed. Also, each images link to its URL on the NYT website.</p>

## Languages and Tools Used
<ul>
<li>HTML</li> 
<li>CSS/SASS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Ajax/JSON</li>
<li>Vagrant/Gulp</li>
<li>Git/Github</li>
</ul>

## Experience
<p>I learned how to pull information from API using ajax request. It was my first use of a CSS preprocessor and of running Gulp, and it made life much easier as SASS helped to use variables, mixins, etc. and Gulp helped to reload the browser automatically.</p>
